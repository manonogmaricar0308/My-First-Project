                                        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>

                                            <h3>Instructions</h3>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, whisk together ¾ cup heavy cream, egg yolks, and granulated sugar and heat over medium heat for about 1-2 minutes until it coats the back of a spoon. Do not boil at any time. Remove from heat and continue whisking about 1-2 minutes. </li>
                                                <li>Add melted chocolate and whisk consistently. Transfer to a bowl and let cool completely. Stir occasionally.</li>
                                                <li>With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whisk ¾ cup heavy cream on medium-high speed until soft peaks form about 2-3 minutes. Add powdered sugar and whisk until stiff peaks form. </li>
                                                <li>Whisk ¼ of the whipped cream into the cooled chocolate. Then gently fold in the remaining whipped cream with a wooden spoon.</li>
                                                <li>Serve immediately if desired (will be very soft) or chill in an airtight container or sealed glasses in the fridge for at least 4-5 hours or overnight (recommended). Before serving remove from the fridge for 10 minutes or until it reaches the desired consistency (will be firm and scoopable straight out of the fridge and gets softer the warmer it gets). Serve with additional toppings of your choice like berries, nuts, chocolate, or whipped cream. Store up to 3 days in the fridge.</li>

                                                    <h4>Top tips</h4>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>Don't boil the egg yolk mixture at any time or you could either end up with scrambled eggs or the chocolate ganache splits. </li>
                                                        <li>Stop folding the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture as soon as it is combined. Don't overmix.</li>
                                                        <li>Give it time to chill in the fridge. Don't place it in the freezer to speed up the chilling process.</li>

                                                    </ul>
                                                    <div>
                                                        <h5>Why did my chocolate split?</h5>
                                                        <div>
                                                            <p>If the chocolate splits and you have an oily film on the surface, then the chocolate was getting too fast too hot in the pan. Make sure that you remove the egg mixture from the heat first, continue whisking for about 1-2 minutes, and then whisk in the chocolate.</p>
                                                            <p>If this happened to you, the first thing you should do is to grab your electric mixer and mix until it comes together. In most cases, this will work fine and saves your ganache. It will be smooth and silky again. You can also mix in 1 tablespoon (15ml) of corn syrup or honey to smooth it.</p>
                                                            <p>If this didn’t help at all, heat up 1-2 tablespoon (15-30ml) of heavy cream and mix it into the ganache little by little. Stop adding heavy cream as soon as it comes together. Normally, this should help.</p>
                                                            <p>What is if your ganache is still broken? Well then you have to face the truth that the chocolate was way too hot, and you better start all over again.</p>
